# Road Anomaly Detection System

## Overview
A machine learning-based system to detect road anomalies such as **potholes** and **cracks** using **image** data**. The model is trained on a combination of **public datasets** and **community-collected photos** to identify and classify anomalies. A web-based dashboard is included for detecting anomalies.

## Features
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detects road anomalies (e.g., potholes, cracks, debris) using image data.
- **Multi-Source Data:** Combines publicly available datasets and local road images to train and evaluate the model.
- **Classification:** Classifies anomalies into categories like potholes, cracks, and surface damage.
- **Visualization:** web-based platform to detect anomalies.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow for model training.
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV for image processing.
- **Backend:** Flask/FastAPI for API services.

## Dataset
- **Online Datasets:** Public pothole/crack datasets from Kaggle.
- **Community Photos:** Local images of road anomalies captured from my community.
